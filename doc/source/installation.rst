============
Installation
============

There are 3 steps to install Gluon:

* Step 1: Install ``etcd``
* Step 2: Install Gluon Plugin and Proton Server
* Step 3 (Optional): Set up Mechanism Driver for Open Contrail

In addition, OPNFV Danube Release will provide a scenario in which Step 1 and
Step 2 can be done automatically to install Gluon. However, Step 3 (optional)
still needs to be manually set up.
